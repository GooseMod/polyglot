# Polyglot Manifesto

### 1. Why have a manifesto

Polyglot, by design, is a project with large scope yet having hoping to have a minor codebase. This manifesto is being created to remain to have some of the project to always have a purpose; if (and likely) the actual project is to fail. Whilst talking pessimistically like this may seem unfortunate, it is revealing to the harsh true nature for the project having such a wide scope.

### 2. The wide, narrow scope

Polyglot has both a wide and narrow scope for it's purpose; wide as it wants to work with the majority of chat applications but narrow due to what it wants to enable. Polyglot's primary goal is to enable theming for such applications. Plugins are a secondary, and optional goal. Themes are hoped to be compatible with (existing) themes made for Discord. This will likely be done in one of two ways, likely to be discussed later on.
