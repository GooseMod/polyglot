# Polyglot Manifesto

### 1. Why have a manifesto

Polyglot, by design, is a project with large scope yet having hoping to have a minor codebase. This manifesto is being created to remain to have some of the project to always have a purpose; if (and likely) the actual project is to fail. Whilst talking pessimistically like this may seem unfortunate, it is revealing to the harsh true nature for the project having such a wide scope.

### 2. The wide, narrow scope

Polyglot has both a wide and narrow scope for it's purpose; wide as it wants to work with the majority of chat applications but narrow due to what it wants to enable. Polyglot's primary goal is to enable theming for such applications. Plugins are a secondary, and optional goal. Themes are hoped to be compatible with (existing) themes made for Discord. This will likely be done in one of two ways, likely to be discussed later on.

### 3. Origin

The origin of Polyglot is the fifth (roughly) iteration of the project. The design has changed drastically, although that is likely not surprisingly for a project with such wide a scope. But the main goal has remained the same: a single mod for most chat applications; without no specific workarounds (if app is Discord do X, if app is Revolt do Y), etc. 

### 4. UI

Originally, using native (to the app) UI was not part of the goal of the project; merely creating something functional. The UI choice for non-native changed over time too: originally planning on using Dear Imgui, then just HTML, CSS, and JS via an extension popout. Now a native-like UI is actually targeted. This (primarily) a benefit to most end users. However, it may end up that this native-like UI is only on the surface; in menus and such it may likely be near-impossible to actually replicate an application's UI if trying to use features it does not have. Therefore, it will likely be only first-visible (being seen alongside native UI, but not in the project's own UI).

### 5. Why

Polyglot is mostly being made to go against traditional thoughts and ideals for modifications of anything. Write one thing, work everywhere. It is designed and made to against mainstream thought and opinion, therefore will likely to be thought nothing of until the singularity of the project occurs - likely to be when v1 is (if) completed.
