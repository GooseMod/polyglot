# Polyglot Manifesto

### 1. Why have a manifesto

Polyglot, by design, is a project with large scope yet having hoping to have a minor codebase. This manifesto is being created to remain to have some of the project to always have a purpose; if (and likely) the actual project is to fail. Whilst talking pessimistically like this may seem unfortunate, it is revealing to the harsh true nature for the project having such a wide scope.
